# Explore the Data

You may first find it helpful to explore the data set by eye. Try to open it and make sense of it. You'll notice at the beginning there is some metadata for the database. There are then many `<page>` elements which each contain a word. An example page is below. 

```
  <page>
    <title>pies</title>
    <ns>0</ns>
    <id>57</id>
    <revision>
      <id>65773446</id>
      <parentid>65690267</parentid>
      <timestamp>2022-02-08T09:58:43Z</timestamp>
