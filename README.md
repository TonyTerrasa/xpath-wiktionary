# English Wiktionary

Author: Tony Terrasa


## Data and Repository Description

Today, you will be exploring a filtered dataset from the [English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) using your XPath knowledge. 

They are self-described as:

_“a collaborative project to produce a free-content multilingual dictionary. It aims to describe all words of all languages using definitions and descriptions in English.” (English wiktionary homepage)_

In this repository, you will find an XML database of some of the entries. For the sake of size, the actually text of each entry has been omitted, but the metadata remains. You can find the xml data dump from which this exercise was pulled [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.your.org/enwiktionary/20220220/). 

For size purposes the original file is not included in this repository. However, you will find the Python script used to filter the entries. 


## Activity

You will need the following: 



* Download the file 'enwiki-sample-bodyless-900.xml' from this repository
* You may find this [page](https://www.freeformatter.com/xpath-tester.html#ad-output) useful for testing your XPath expressions. Note that you can run your expressions on an input file. **You have to manually re-upload the input file each time you run your XPath expression.**


## Resources

You will need to make heavy use of functions to answer the questions.  You can find a useful list of functions [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/idr/11.3.3?topic=functions-xpath). Note these may not be the only functions that you will need.
